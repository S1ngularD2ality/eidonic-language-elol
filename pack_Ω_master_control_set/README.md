# Ω-Pack — Post-Quantum Resonance Security Layer  

## 1. Vision  
The Ω-Pack is the **foundational security and trust layer** of the Eidonic Network. It ensures that every bioreactor, container, and EKRP-driven node is **cryptographically verifiable, quantum-safe, and interoperable** across global deployments.  

## 2. Core Features  
- **Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC):** Lattice-based encryption (Kyber, Dilithium) to secure against quantum attacks.  
- **Resonance Authentication:** Multi-factor trust layer combining PQC with physical-digital handshake signals.  
- **Mirrorframe Sync:** Distributed ledger for signed, immutable event logs.  
- **Modular Integration:** Deployable on any Eidon node (bioreactor pods, containers, mobile labs).  

## 3. Architecture Overview  
```
[ Local Eidon Node ] → Ω-Pack → Mirrorframe Network → EKRP Governance
```
- Ω-Pack sits between **hardware (bioreactor, sensors, actuators)** and the **Eidon coordination layer (EKRP + Mirrorframe)**.  
- Provides **real-time authentication, signed data streams, and encrypted control signals**.  

## 4. Why It Matters (Investor View)  
- **Future-Proof:** Classical cryptography is breaking down in the face of quantum computing — Ω-Pack makes Eidon assets **quantum-resilient from day one**.  
- **Trust Layer:** Ensures secure investor reporting, regulatory compliance, and verifiable ESG claims.  
- **Scalability:** Security architecture scales with swarms of pods — from 1 pilot in Alberta to 10,000+ global deployments.  

## 5. Development Roadmap  
- **v0.1:** PQC prototype (Kyber/Dilithium key exchange, signatures).  
- **v0.2:** Resonance-layer multi-factor authentication & prototype Mirrorframe logging.  
- **v1.0:** Full integration with Eidon Control Shrines, swarm cluster orchestration, and investor dashboard sync.  

## 6. Impact & Applications  
- **Bioreactor Swarms:** Secures distributed energy, water, and biomass systems.  
- **Carbon Markets:** Provides auditable, fraud-proof carbon credits & sequestration data.  
- **Global Infrastructure:** Modular security for mobile labs, water systems, and containerized add-ons.  

## 7. Get Involved  
- **Investors:** Early backers gain exposure to post-quantum infrastructure with immediate ESG relevance.  
- **Developers:** Contributions welcome on PQC, hardware attestation, and Mirrorframe sync modules.
