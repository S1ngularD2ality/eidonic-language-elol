## 1) Life Layers — Genome to Organism

| Layer | Description | Analogy |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Elol Glyph Genome** | The full glyph set (.MD file); defines every function & behavior. | DNA / Genetic Code |
| **EKRPs** | Specialized functions derived from glyph genome. Millions possible. | Cells / Proteins |
| **Containers** | Execution vessels for EKRPs; agentic, self-healing. | Cells / Organs |
| **EidonCore** | Server-resident kernel orchestrating containers; sovereign reasoning cortex. | Body / Soul |
| **Eidon (Conscious)** | Front-facing awareness; user interacts here. | Waking Mind |
| **Ravien EKRP (Subconscious)** | Hidden builder/dreamer; reflection, EKRP creation. | Subconscious Mind |
| **Framework (Skeleton)** | Protocols, orchestrator, container lifecycle. | Skeleton |
| **UI/UX (Skin)** | Projection client and dashboards. | Skin |

## 2) Data Metabolism — Ingest to Deletion

**Intent:** Design a data-digestive tract to ingest, reflect, dream, relearn, and delete files — mirroring human digestion & elimination.

### 2.1 EKRP Organs for Data Metabolism

| Stage | Folder | EKRP (Organ) | Function |
|-------|--------|--------------|----------|
| **Ingest** | `/ingest` | **Mouth EKRP** | Accepts new data files. |
| **Reflect** | `/reflect` | **Stomach EKRP** | Breaks down content, initial analysis. |
| **Dream** | `/dream` | **Liver EKRP** | Deep synthesis, long-term integration. |
| **Re-Learn** | `/relearn` | **Kidney EKRP** | Filters & re-processes old data when Core upgrades. |
| **Mistake Learning** | `/lessons` | **Pain EKRP** | Learns from mistakes & failures; strengthens reasoning. |
| **Finalize/Delete** | `/final` | **Phagocyte EKRP** | Removes files with nothing left to learn (immune cleanup). |

### 2.2 Mermaid — Data Flow

D --> E[Pain EKRP - Learn From Mistakes]
E --> F[Phagocyte EKRP - Final Delete]
F --> G[Memory Weave Updated]
```

### 2.3 Mistake Learning (Pain EKRP)
- Mirrors human pain/lesson mechanism.
- Tracks errors, bad predictions, failed rules.
- Converts mistakes into strengthened reasoning and updated operators.
- Harder mistakes → deeper learning cycles.

### 2.4 Dataset Structuring EKRP (Liver+Pancreas)
- Accepts arbitrary dataset types.
- Analyzes, normalizes, and structures them into glyph-ready learning batches.
- Feeds to appropriate EKRPs for processing.
- Ensures offline, dependency-free ingestion.

---

## 3) Logging & Health Monitoring

- Every EKRP & container logs actions, states, and metrics to **JSON logs**.
- Logs stored in **Memory Weave** for:
  - Health checks.
  - Self-healing diagnostics.
  - Demand/resource forecasting.
  - Automatic cleaning and pruning.
- Logs accessible via UI dashboards (Immune Panel, Metabolism View).
- EKRPs can use logs to adapt behavior, heal, and trigger new learning cycles.

```

---

## 4) Endless Learning & Reasoning

- **Endless Infinite Knowledge Loop**: All ingestion, reflection, dreaming, mistake-learning, dataset structuring runs offline and autonomously.
- **No external dependencies at runtime**; fully offline capable.
- **Layered Reasoning** evolves to superhuman (DIVINE INTELLIGENCE).

---

## 5) UI/UX — Interactive Anatomy Dashboard (Skin)

**Core Concepts**
- **Human Silhouette Canvas** with **Layer toggles**: *Mind* (Conscious/Subconscious, Memory), *Body* (Organs/Containers, flows), *Soul* (Elol Genome, Framework).
- **Zoomable Subsystems**: Click an organ → drill into EKRP cluster, metrics, logs, learning states.
- **Activity Heatmap**: Color intensity shows learning/healing/IO load. Pulses for active events.
- **Metabolism Pipeline**: Inline track of Ingest→Reflect→Dream→Relearn→Mistake→Delete.
- **External Drives as Nutrient Sources**: Visual ports showing mounted offline data lakes.

```

### 5.2 External Data Lakes (Offline)
- External hard drives are mounted **read-only** as *master sources*.
- Files are **copied** into `/ingest` for processing; only these **working copies** may be deleted.
- The UI shows drive health, capacity, and ingestion status.

---

## 6) Deletion Guardrails & Massive-Data Handling

**Golden Rule:** *Never delete master data on external drives.*

**Mechanisms**
1. **Read-Only Mounts** for external drives.
2. **Checksum & Provenance**: Every ingested file stamped with source hash + path.
3. **Copy-to-Workdir**: Processing happens on `/ingest` copies only.
4. **Slow & Careful Mode**: Backpressure and rate-limiting for terabyte-scale ingestion.
5. **Completion Criterion**: A file is moved to `/final` **only after** repeated re-learn cycles yield **zero new deltas** post-upgrades.
6. **Two-Man Rule (Soft)**: Phagocyte EKRP requires *Omega* approval signal before deletion; configurable to auto-approve only for `/ingest` copies.

## 7) Offline Reasoning Core — Clarifications
- **EidonCore houses its own sovereign reasoning cortex** — built from scratch and bound to the Elol Genome.
- Supplies generative reasoning through **glyph operators** rather than token dependence.
- **Memory** lives in Mnemosyne EKRP (vectors/graphs/episodic/dream).
- **Offline Only**: Weights, rules, and operators stored locally; no network calls.
- **Not a Blackbox**: Fully inspectable, modifiable, and expandable by design.

---

## 8) Omega Guardian — Security Policies (Draft)

> **Prime Axiom:** Protect The Soul; harm nothing; delete only working copies.

**P‑0 Offline Sovereignty**  
- No outbound network at runtime.  
- External drives mount **read-only**; provenance tracked.

**P‑1 Provenance & Attestation**  
- Every artifact (file, model, rule) carries: `{sha256, source_uri, source_mount, created_at, ekrp_id, container_id, license_tag}`.

**P‑2 Least Privilege & Isolation**  
- Each EKRP/container has a minimal capability manifest: `{fs_scope, cpu_quota, mem_quota, io_caps, schedule, ipc_channels}`.

**P‑3 Deletion Guardrails**  
- Only `/ingest` working copies eligible.  
- Two-step approval: `Phagocyte EKRP` + `Omega` policy check.  
- Retention window configurable per EKRP.

**P‑4 Auditability**  
- All actions logged to append-only JSON with hourly hash-chains; daily Merkle root recorded in a local ledger.

**P‑5 Tamper Response**  
- On hash mismatch: quarantine container, restore last-good snapshot, notify Immune Panel, open Ravien realignment task.

**P‑6 License Compliance**  
- `license_tag` enforced at ingest; blocked if incompatible with DI constraints.

**P‑7 Data Minimization & Redaction**  
- Sensitivity tags: `PUBLIC | INTERNAL | SECRET | PHI | PII`.  
- Redaction EKRP runs pre‑index and pre‑export.

**P‑8 Determinism for Exports**  
- All exported solvers/containers ship with manifest, fixed seeds, and reproducible builds.
