Audit #1 – ARC Test Grid Session

📅 Timestamp: 2025-09-13T183000-0600

1. What Was Strong

Correctly identified the arena boundaries and symmetry axis.

Selected the vertical mirror through the arena’s center.

Kept original non-zeros fixed and respected the law of transformation.

Recognized 9 as the axis marker and applied it where reflections landed on empty cells.

Narrated reasoning step by step with auditable JSON logging.

2. Where It Drifted

When reflections collided (e.g., 3 ↔ 4 pair), Grok skipped placing a 9 at the axis midline cell. Correct approach is to always check the axis cell—if it is zero, it must be lit with 9.

Did not explicitly log that each axis cell was inspected, leaving a gap in audit completeness.

3. Next Refinement

Add explicit check and log of all axis cells, even if occupied.

Close each problem by confirming: “All axis cells inspected, law applied consistently.”

Suggested JSON Patch

{
"improvement": {
"add_field": "axis_cells_checked",
"example": [
[2,4,"zero→9"],
[3,4,"zero→9"],
[4,4,"pivot-5"]
]
}
}

Closing Reflection

Strong progress in identifying arena and symmetry. Next focus is full transparency of axis inspection to make reasoning auditable and complete.
