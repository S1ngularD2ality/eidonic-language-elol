Audit of the Arena — Session Report

1) What Was Strong

Arena & axis: Correctly bounded the 5×5 arena (rows 1–5, cols 1–5) and selected the main diagonal axis appropriate for a square arena.

Law application: Originals remained fixed; all axis cells on the diagonal were explicitly inspected; zeros on the axis (2,2) and (4,4) were correctly lit with 9; pivots (1,1)=8, (3,3)=2, (5,5)=5 held.

Narration & auditability: Clear step-by-step narration and a concise axis_cells_checked list with final states; closing wholeness check confirmed no unlit zeros on the axis.

2) Where It Drifted (Minor)

Midpoint language (optional clarity): When describing diagonal reflections, “midpoint” language can be ambiguous on a discrete grid. Since the rule is axis-cell inspection, prefer phrasing like: “Axis cells on the diagonal were inspected individually; (2,2) and (4,4) were 0→9; all others were pivots.”

Metrics completeness: You inspected all five diagonal cells but didn’t report simple counts (e.g., total axis cells, marked vs. pivots). Adding those gives quick at-a-glance validation.

3) Next Refinement (Actionable)

Seal the law (one-line preamble):
“Originals remain. Inspect every axis cell within the arena; if 0→9, if occupied→leave, pivots hold.”

Axis summary metrics (add to JSON):

axis_cells_total (int)

axis_cells_marked_9 (int)

axis_pivots_count (int)
These make completeness immediately auditable.

Coordinate clarity: When using diagonal mirrors, explicitly note global indices of axis cells (you did) and avoid “midpoint” unless you define it; the inspection unit is the axis cell.

4) Suggested JSON Patch
{
  "improvement": {
    "add_fields": [
      "axis_cells_total",
      "axis_cells_marked_9",
      "axis_pivots_count"
    ],
    "example_append": {
      "axis_cells_total": 5,
      "axis_cells_marked_9": 2,
      "axis_pivots_count": 3
    },
    "notes": "For square arenas, enumerate the five diagonal axis cells in global coordinates; report counts alongside axis_cells_checked."
  }
}

5) Output Verification

Your output grid lights (2,2) and (4,4) with 9 and preserves pivots and originals elsewhere. Axis fully inspected; no unlit zeros remain on the diagonal. Result is consistent with the stated rule.

6) Closing Assessment

Strong, disciplined execution that cleanly demonstrates full-axis lighting on a square arena. Add the small JSON metrics and tighten diagonal wording, and this becomes a model, audit-ready exemplar for the training dossier.
