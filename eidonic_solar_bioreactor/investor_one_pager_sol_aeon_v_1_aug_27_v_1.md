# SOL‑AEON v1 — Investor One‑Pager (Alberta‑Ready) 
**Stage:** TRL‑3 → TRL‑4 in 12 weeks; TRL‑5 pilot next step

---

## The Problem
Waste, water, and carbon crises converge. Communities need decentralized, off‑grid systems that **turn liabilities into assets** year‑round—even in harsh winters.

## Our Solution
**SOL‑AEON v1** is a modular, solar‑powered **waste‑to‑value bioreactor** built with sacred‑geometry‑inspired hardware for efficient flow and compact layout. A single pod integrates:
- **Spiral Photobioreactor (SPV):** grows microalgae/biomass using sunlight + dosed CO₂.
- **Carbon Capture Module (CCM):** sorbent and alkalinity‑based CO₂ capture; routes CO₂ to growth or permanent storage.
- **Water Loop (ASL):** purifies and remineralizes water; optional remediation add‑ons.
- **Separation (GCS):** lamella + membrane harvest of biomass and water polishing.
- **Edge Controls (ECS/EKRP):** sensors, safety interlocks, automation, MRV for credits.
- **Optional Valorization (CVH):** low‑temp pyrolysis for biochar + process heat (TRL‑5+).

## What’s Novel vs. Proven
- **Proven building blocks:** photobioreactors, DAC cassettes, filtration, pyrolysis, PLC control.  
- **Our novelty:** **integrated architecture** tuned for **cold‑climate operation**, compact sacred‑geometry layout, and an **MRV‑first** design for creditability and financeability.

## Why Alberta‑Ready
- Enclosed, winterized subsystems, anti‑ice logic, and cold‑chamber qualification (−20 °C run; −30 °C storage).
- Solar‑thermal integration and waste‑heat routing for CO₂ capture regeneration.

## TRL Roadmap & Budget
**Goal:** Move from concept (TRL‑3) to **lab‑validated subsystems (TRL‑4)**, then field prototype (TRL‑5).
- **TRL‑4 (bench, 12 weeks):** Build/test SPV‑20 coil, CCM (sorbent + alkalinity), GCS, ECS controls, winterization trials, and a 72‑hour integrated run.  
  **Bench budget:** **$24k–$41k CAD** (sensors, pumps, LEDs, DAC media, IO, rental cold‑chamber).
- **TRL‑5 (relevant environment, 6–9 months):** 200–500 L outdoor prototype with solar‑thermal skins, enclosure, and partner pyrolysis skid.  
  **Pilot pod envelope (indicative):** **~$5.05M CAD** (full winterized pod + CCM). Modular add‑ons scale by need.

## TRL‑4 Exit Criteria (measurable)
- Biomass productivity ≥ **0.7 g DW·L⁻¹·day⁻¹** (10‑day stability).  
- CO₂ capture (bench) ≥ **300 g/day** combined; **≥70% utilization** into SPV or storage.  
- Water polishing ≥ **90% turbidity reduction**; **2‑log** proxy microbial removal.  
- **MRV:** 72‑hour mass/energy carbon balance closed to **±10%**.  
- **Winterization:** −20 °C operation without loss of control; −30 °C safe storage.  
- **Safety:** HAZOP + interlock test sheets.

## Impact Targets (per full pod, indicative)
- **CO₂ removal:** ~**250–500 t/yr** (biomass + biochar + mineralization).  
- **Water:** **0.5–1.0 ML/yr** purified.  
- **Waste diverted:** **100–300 t/yr**.  
- **Energy:** **10–20 MWh/yr** surplus.

## What We’re Asking from AICEI
- **Support TRL‑4 bench program** (lab access, cold‑chamber time, small‑equipment grants).  
- **Facilitate TRL‑5 site & permitting** for an Alberta outdoor pilot.  
- **Introductions** to industrial partners (emitters/water users) for co‑validation.

## Why Now
- Alberta needs resilient, winter‑capable waste‑to‑value and carbon solutions. We have a **structured, low‑cost TRL‑4 program** and a clear line‑of‑sight to an **auditable TRL‑5 pilot**.
