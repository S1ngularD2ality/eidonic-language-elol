# SOL‑AEON v1 — Investor One‑Pager 
**Stage:** TRL‑3 → TRL‑4 Pilot Pod

---

## The Problem
Waste, water, and carbon challenges converge in Alberta’s oil sands. Operators need modular systems that **turn liabilities into assets** year‑round — even in harsh winters.

## Our Solution
**SOL‑AEON v1** is a modular, solar‑powered **waste‑to‑value bioreactor pod** designed for cold‑climate deployment. A single pod integrates:
- **Spiral Photobioreactor (SPV):** grows microalgae/biomass using sunlight and site CO2.
- **Carbon Capture Module (CCM):** captures flue/process CO2 and routes it to growth or stable storage.
- **Water Remediation (WRM):** polishes process and tailings‑influenced waters.
- **Gas & Solids Separation (GCS):** clarifies biomass, polishes water, and manages off‑gas.
- **Edge Controls & MRV:** integrated sensors, interlocks, automation, and reporting for verifiable credits.
- **Optional Valorization:** pyrolysis module for biochar and process heat (scales as needed).

## What’s Novel vs. Proven
- **Proven building blocks:** photobioreactors, DAC cassettes, filtration, pyrolysis, PLC control.
- **Our novelty:** fully **integrated pod architecture** tuned for **winterized Alberta conditions**, compact layout, and an **MRV‑first design**.

## Why Oil Sands-Aligned
- Modular pod sits at the interface of **tailings ponds, SAGD water loops, and upgrading CO2 sources**.
- Designed for **winterized operation**, waste‑heat integration, and compliance with MRV standards.

## TRL Roadmap (Pod‑Centric)
**Goal:** Advance from TRL‑3 (defined design and subsystem validation) to a **pilot pod (TRL‑4/5)** in relevant environment.
- **TRL‑3:** Completed subsystem definition and integration design.
- **TRL‑4 (Pod Build):** Fabricate and commission first integrated pilot pod; validate biomass, water, and CO2 performance under controlled but site‑relevant conditions.
- **TRL‑5 (Field Pilot):** Deploy full pod at oil sands site; run MRV‑verified campaign for water reuse, CO2 utilization, and biomass valorization.

## Exit Criteria (Pod Pilot)
- Biomass productivity and stability.
- CO2 capture and utilization efficiency.
- Water polishing effectiveness against site discharge/reuse criteria.
- MRV‑verified mass/energy balance closure.
- Safe operation at winter extremes.

## Impact Targets (per full pod, indicative)
- **CO2 removal:** ~250–500 t/yr (biomass + biochar + mineralization).
- **Water:** 0.5–1.0 ML/yr polished.
- **Waste diverted:** 100–300 t/yr.
- **Energy:** 10–20 MWh/yr surplus.

## What We’re Asking
- **Support pilot pod fabrication and commissioning.**
- **Facilitate site integration** with tailings/process water, CO2 streams, and low‑grade heat.
- **Partnerships** with operators for validation and MRV‑aligned deployment.

## Why Now
Modular, verifiable solutions for water, carbon, and waste. SOL‑AEON offers a **single deployable pod** that addresses these needs and produces auditable impact.
