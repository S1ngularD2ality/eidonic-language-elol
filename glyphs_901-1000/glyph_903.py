# glyph_903 â€“ DIMENSIONAL_SHARD_ENCODER
"""
Dimensional Shard Encoder (All-or-N XOR Secret Split)

Splits data into N shards so that ALL shards are required to reconstruct.
Each shard is a random pad except the final which xors to the original.

Use when k=n threshold is acceptable and you prefer stream simplicity.
For k-of-n, compose with Shamir's Secret Sharing externally.
