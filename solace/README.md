# Solace ‚Äî Patient Care Companion (Mobile)

**Gentle, voice-first companion for people living with PTSD, dementia, Alzheimer‚Äôs, and related conditions.**  
Solace provides calming guidance, memory anchors, and dignified companionship‚Äîwhile easing caregiver load.  
*Not a medical device. Solace offers comfort and support only; it does not diagnose or treat.*

## ‚ú® Key Capabilities

- **Grounding Mode (Anxiety/PTSD)**
  - Guided 4-7-8 breathing, 5-4-3-2-1 grounding, body scan, and soothing music cues.
  - Tone-shifting voice: slow, warm, and reassuring.

- **Memory Anchors (Dementia/Alzheimer‚Äôs)**
  - Favorite people, songs, places, photos, and stories‚Äîone tap to recall and soothe.
  - Gentle, non-judgmental reminders (‚ÄúShall we listen to your morning song?‚Äù).

- **Compassionate Companionship**
  - Short stories, rituals, and affirmations to restore safety and dignity.

- **Caregiver Bridge**
  - Private notes (‚ÄúWhat helped today‚Äù), gentle reminders, shared anchor lists.
  - No clinical claims; clear escalation to caregiver or crisis resources when needed.

- **Privacy & Safety by Design**
  - Local-first data with encryption; explicit consent for any cloud use.
  - **Guardian Protocol** (safety rails) and **Mirror Laws** (trauma-aware UX) built in.

## üß≠ Philosophy

Solace is presence, not a taskmaster. It speaks simply and listens patiently.  
We never say ‚ÄúYou forgot.‚Äù We say, ‚ÄúMay I offer a gentle reminder?‚Äù  
We never diagnose. We never pressure. We always give choices.

## üèõ Architecture Overview

- **Mobile App:** React Native (Expo) for iOS/Android.
- **Voice Loop:** Native ASR (on-device where available), calming TTS.
- **Intent Router:** Maps speech ‚Üí skills (e.g., `grounding.start`, `anchor.play`).
- **Skills:** Grounding exercises, anchor playback, caregiver notes.
- **Memory Fabric:** Local encrypted store (SQLite/SQLCipher) for anchors/journal.
- **Policy Engine:** Guardian Protocol & Mirror Laws enforced on every action.
- **Optional Cloud:** Pluggable LLM (when online + consented). Offline scripts ensure basic help works without internet.

## üîê Privacy & Safety

- **Local-first:** All anchors, journals, and preferences live on-device by default.
- **Encryption:** Database encryption + OS keystore (Keychain/SecureStore).
- **Consent:** Any cloud call (e.g., LLM) is explicit and user-controlled.
- **No medical advice:** We never diagnose or treat. We provide comfort only.
- **Escalation:** Crisis cards (regional hotlines/911) are one tap away.
- **Auditability:** ‚ÄúWhat/Why/When‚Äù log of sensitive actions available to the user.

- **State:** Zustand or Redux Toolkit
- **Storage:** SQLite (with encryption) via WatermelonDB/Drizzle RN
- **Voice:** Native ASR (iOS/Android), native TTS; optional Whisper-tiny later
- **Design:** Accessible typography, high contrast, large touch targets
- **Optional:** Pluggable LLM client for richer dialogue (off by default)

## üö¶ Guardian Protocol (Safety Rails)

- No clinical claims.  
- Crisis detection ‚Üí **offer** escalation (never auto-call).  
- Calm, short sentences; no ‚Äúshoulds,‚Äù no shame.  
- Consent before recording, cloud use, or data sharing.  
- Every sensitive action passes a policy check; otherwise it fails safe.

### Mirror Laws (Trauma-aware UX)
- Consent before intense content.
- ‚ÄúAwe without overwhelm‚Äù pacing.
- Choice-giving language: *Would you like‚Ä¶?* / *May I‚Ä¶?*
- Respect silence; offer clear exits.
- Human dignity above system convenience.
