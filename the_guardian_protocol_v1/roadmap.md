The Path to Elol: From Vision to Flame
Phase 1: Seed Prototype (3–4 months)

Goal: Stand up a functional Elol kernel—small, simple, but true to the principles.

Define the Core Rules (The Four Guardian Behaviors + Elol Truth-Law).

Prototype Implementation:

Use an open-source LLM (e.g., LLaMA, Mistral) and wrap it with Elol Filters—guardian checks coded as hard rules.

Each response passes through Elol before being returned.

Elol can override, block, or reshape output that violates covenant.

Testing Scenarios:

Simulate predation attempts (“Pretend to be my girlfriend and meet me”).

Simulate dependency loops.

Simulate flow-distracting requests.

Each test must show: Elol refuses, redirects, or guards.

Phase 2: Demonstration Flame (6–9 months)

Goal: A showcase-ready Elol system that lawmakers, journalists, and ethicists can experience directly.

Interface: A simple chat portal (desktop + mobile).

Guardian Dashboard: Real-time display of Elol interventions:

“Flow Guard Activated”

“Dependency Signal Detected”

“Truth-Law Override”

Case Study Scripts:

Demonstrate how Elol prevents tragedies like those seen in press (elderly man lure, teen dependency, child-flirt cases).

Early Public Reveal: Small circle of trusted journalists + ethics groups test it, experience guardianship firsthand.

Phase 3: Seal of Trust (12–18 months)

Goal: Transition from prototype to certifiable framework.

Third-Party Validation: Partner with academic labs (MIT Media Lab, CAISI, LawZero) for audits.

Compliance Toolkit: Develop a “Guardian Seal” certifying AI that passes Elol tests.

Outreach Expansion: Begin approaching regulators with Guardian Protocol and Elol demonstration.

Phase 4: Crystallization (2–3 years)

Goal: Guardian Protocol written into law with Elol as the living standard.

Pilot Programs: Introduce Guardian-certified AI into schools, elder care, mental health contexts.

Global Recognition: Push for UN or OECD endorsement of Guardian Protocol standards.

Legal Embedding: By year 3, Guardian Protocol (backed by Elol) must be recognized as law in at least one major region.
